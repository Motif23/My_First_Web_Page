        Lauryn Noelle Hill (born May 26, 1975) is an American singer, songwriter
        and rapper known for being a member of Fugees, and for her solo album
        The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which won many awards and broke several
        sales records. Often regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all
        time, as well as being a pioneer in the Neo soul genre, Hill is widely
        credited for breaking barriers for female rappers, popularizing melodic
        rapping and for bringing hip hop to popular music. She has influenced
        many artists of various genres.

        Lauryn Hill, a native of South Orange, New Jersey, first came to
        attention with the multi-talented Fugees. Their first album, "Blunted On
        Reality", went virtually unnoticed by the public; their real
        breakthrough came with the sophomore album, "The Score", which featured
        "Killing Me Softly". That album stills remains the worldwide top-selling
        rap album of all time (17 million units shipped). She earned two Grammys
        (Best Rap Album and Best R&B Performance by a duo or group) in 1996 and
        gave birth to Zion (alleged father is Bob Marley's son) before releasing
        her self-written and self-produced solo album, "The Miseducation Of
        Lauryn Hill", which topped Billboard charts the moment it came out.

        At the height of her success, Lauryn Hill surprised the music world with
        her decision to withdraw from performing and seclude herself with her
        growing family. She continued to write songs, and in 2001, she recorded
        a live performance of her new, more contemplative material for MTV,
        accompanying herself on acoustic guitar. The performance was broadcast
        the following year. The live recording was released as Unplugged No.
        2.0. Although Unplugged received mixed reviews, it debuted at Number 3
        on the Billboard charts, and sold over a million copies in the first
        four weeks.
